# Framer Motion Practice Repository

This repository was created to practice and explore the capabilities of [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), a popular library for animation in React. The examples in this project are based on the official Framer Motion documentation and are intended to provide hands-on experience with key concepts.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to replicate and experiment with the animation techniques provided on the [Framer Motion website](https://www.framer.com/motion/). Each example demonstrates different features of the library to build a solid understanding of how to implement animations in React projects.

## Examples

The following examples are included in the repository:

1. **Animations** - Basic animations, exploring keyframes, transitions, and ease functions.
2. **Variants** - Using variants to simplify animations across multiple elements.
3. **Gestures** - Animating based on user interactions such as taps and hover.
4. **Drag** - Adding draggable elements and customizing drag constraints.
5. **Scroll** - Creating scroll-based animations triggered by the scroll position.
6. **Path** - Animating paths using SVG for advanced vector-based animations.
